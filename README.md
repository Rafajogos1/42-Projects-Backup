# 42-Projects-Backup
A repository to store my 42 school projects as I make them.  
If you're using my projects as guide, I do not recommend using the ones that say "Currently doing it", as they are not finnished and may change a lot. This was simply a backup for my projects, but the tools I've made to test some functions have been proving useful to others, so I decided to make the repository public. **Also, keep in mind that, by checking other people's codes, you won't evolve much. I know it's tempting and sometimes you may end up findng something new, but you'll never get to the answer yourself by doing it.**

libft - Bonus included - 125%
