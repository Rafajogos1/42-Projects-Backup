# 42-Projects-Backup
This is a backup repository for my projects at 42 that I eventually made public to help my colleagues.  
**Even though nobody is going to stop you from checking other people's codes, try not to rely on it. You won't learn from copying and pasting.**  
**With that said, if you're going to check my code anyway, the projects that say "Currently doing" are *NOT FINISHED*, so expect them to have errors or not to run at all, as, like I wrote earlier, the repository was once private and was only a backup.**
