# 42-Projects-Backup
A repository to store my 42 school projects as I make them.  

**Rank 00**  
libft - Bonus included - 125%  

**Rank 01**  
get_next_line - No bonus - 100%  
ft_printf - No bonus - 100%  
born2beroot - 100%

**Rank 02**  
push_swap - Currently doing it  
minitalk - Currently doing it  

**Included libft to use in projects**  
*(All the projects before Rank 02 use an outdated version of **libft** where the **uintptr_t** data type was in a different library.)*  

If you're checking my projects as guide, I do not recommend using the ones that say "Currently doing it", as they are not finnished and may change a lot. This was simply a backup for my projects, but both my projects and the tools I've made to test some functions have been proving useful to others, so I decided to make the repository public. **Also, keep in mind that you're not actually developing your coding skills by checking other people's codes, so, even though no one is going to stop you from doing it please try not to make this a habit.** Good luck.
