In this project you will be introduced to virtualization. You'll also have to use your folder in sgoinfre as the virtual machine takes a lot of space.  
-You will create a Virtual Machine using either Debian or CentOS (you'll have to justify your choice) along with multiple instructions in the subject.  
-Most of the project is just following the subject and doing a step at the time and you can easily find how to do each (I might add it to this Readme later if I have the time).  
-You'll also have to do a script called with the file name `monitoring.sh` that will display various information of the system every 10 minutes upon the start of the server (read about cron).  

*Bonus include doing extra partitions and creating a website for the project.*
