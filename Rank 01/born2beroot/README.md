In this project you will be introduced to virtualization. You'll also have to use your folder in `sgoinfre` (it has the same name as your username on intra) as the virtual machine takes a lot of space. This is the first project (besides Shell00 and Shell01 from the Piscine) that isn't made in C, as you need to create a `Virtual Machine` in the appropiated software (you'll use Virtual Box). The evaluation is very tedious and requires you to really understand everything properly, so be sure to be prepared (this doesn't mean it is very difficult, just make sure you understand all the concepts).  
-You will create a Virtual Machine using either Debian or CentOS (you'll have to justify your choice) along with multiple instructions in the subject.  
-Most of the project is just following the subject and doing a step at the time and you can easily find how to do each (I might add a guide to this Readme later if I have the time).  
-You'll also have to do a script called with the file name `monitoring.sh` that will display various information of the system every 10 minutes upon the start of the server (read about cron).  

*Bonus include doing extra partitions and creating a page for the project in Wordpress or something similar.*
