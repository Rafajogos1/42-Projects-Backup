# ft_printf

As the title suggests, you'll have to create your own printf.  
-Your printf will have to do the following conversions: "c - character; s - string; p - pointer in hexadecimal fomrat; d - decimal; i - integer;  
u - unsigned decimal; x - lowercase hexadecimal; X - uppercase hexadecimal; % - printing a %"  
-The buffer management of the original printf is not to be implemented.

*Bonus includes doing the management of the follwing flags: "-O# + (each character is a flag, the space included)."*
